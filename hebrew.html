										<h1>Hebrew Wisdom</h1>
									</header>

<p>There is wisdom hidden in Genesis 11:9, and its accessible when you realize that it was originally written in the language of the perfect creator of the heavens and earth. This is the real language in which he revealed his set-apart name. All other languages are dialects of babel.</p>

<p>Using wisdom from Genesis 11:9, compare the word for "burnt offering" in the original Genesis 22:2 to the Quran "deity" name given in Arabic (babel). They sound the same! Then compare the true meaning of the false deity name to the fiery and explosive way that many worshipers of it are destroyed.</p>

<p>Wisdom from Genesis 11:9 shows the importance of using the real phonetics of the set-apart name of the creator of the heavens and earth in worship. Worshiping him by an unaccepted name that he never gave breaks his 1st commandment and brings destruction as the fruit of Islam shows.</p>

<p>The original Exodus 20:7 commandment contains the set-apart name of the creator of the heavens and earth that we are not to misuse, but nearly all bibles remove it! Misusing names that aren't his, mistranslations, or titles like "Lord" does not actually break the important Exodus 20:7 law.</p>

<p>In Matthew 4:10, Yashuah quoted a verse originally written in his perfect father's language when saying who the only one to worship is. Use the phonetics of his father's set-apart name from this language in worship. Mistranslations with different phonetics are not the same name!</p>

<p>Hebrew Psalm 112:1 contains a shortened name of the perfect creator of the heavens and earth spelled only with the first 2 letters of his set-apart name: יה ('Yah' in English). This blessed shortened name is in many other Hebrew names which then become statements of faith and praise.</p>

<p>The name "Israel" is a mistranslation of ישראל which is actually pronounced Yah-Shur-El, a statement of truth that "Yah [is the] Correct Deity." His name is in the 1st syllable of the word ישר for "correct." The context of the nation of Yahshurel's creation proves this is true.</p>

<p>The 1st י syllable has an unwritten 'a' vowel after it, causing that 1st syllable to then have the same sound as the set-apart 2-letter name of the perfect creator of the heavens and earth.</p>

<p>The name of the anointed one is ישוע in Aramaic. The same word in Hebrew is ישועה which means salvation, deliverance, welfare, prosperity, and victory. It is pronounced Yah-Shu-Ah, a statement that "Yah [is] Salvation" as his perfect father's shortened name is in the 1st syllable.</p>

<p>The translation of Aramaic ישוע to the English needs an unwritten 'a' vowel after the 1st י syllable, so "Yashuah" phonetically. This states an important truth matching both Isaiah 43:11 and Matthew 1:21.</p>

<p>This article will be updated with more vital Hebrew wisdom.</p>
