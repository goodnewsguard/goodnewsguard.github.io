										<h1>Proper Baptism</h1>
									</header>

									<p>A true baptism is done how Yashuah said in Matthew 28:19. He said to use 3 specific NAMES, not titles like "son" or "father"! The three set-apart Hebrew names with the proper phonetics must be used and without any words between them:</p>
<p><code>
"&#60;Father's Hebrew name&#62;, &#60;Son's Hebrew name&#62;, &#60;Hebrew Set-Apart Spirit name&#62;."
</code></p>

<p>As a mistranslated name with different phonetics is not the same name, the original Hebrew names need to be used. Nearly every important name in the Bible has lost the original phonetics due to being mistranslated from Hebrew to Greek in the Old Testament and Aramaic to Greek in the New Testament. Some of these, such as the name of the anointed one, were phonetically mistranslated AGAIN from Greek to Latin.</p>

<p>The first set-apart name in Yashuah's baptism formula is NOT "Jehovah". See Strong's Hebrew Lexicon Words #1942 and #1943. The wondrous name of the creator of the heavens and earth sounds completely different, and its not in the Quran either. Do NOT use "Jehovah" for the father's name in Yashuah's baptism formula!</p>

<p>His set-apart name was given in Hebrew and was recorded in the Hebrew Torah. Study Deuteronomy 13 and Exodus 20:1-6 with a Hebrew English Interlinear. Learning his set-apart and wondrous name is a great reward that many never get access to. Keep his name set-apart, and never misuse it. Know that he is the only one we are to worship, just as Yashuah said in Matthew 4:10 and Matthew 22:37-38.</p>

<p>The name of the anointed son of the creator of the heavens and earth was given as ישוע in Aramaic. The same word in Hebrew is ישועה which means salvation, deliverance, welfare, prosperity, and victory. It is pronounced Yah-Shu-Ah, a statement that "Yah [is] Salvation" as his perfect father's shortened name is in the first syllable.</p>

<p>"Ruach Qodesh" is not the 3rd set-apart name in Yashuah's baptism formula as that is the *title* of it in Hebrew. To learn the actual name of the Set-Apart Spirit: First obey Yashuah, then seek his all-knowing father's set-apart name from Hebrew scriptures, then humbly ask him.</p>

<p>The baptism command that Yashuah gave is actually for education, and he teaches you in spirit when the baptism is done how he said. This is a better education than you can imagine, and there are multople incredible benefits of having the anointed one with you in spirit. Seek a proper baptism today.</p>
