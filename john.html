										<h1>The "John" Gospel Is Not Trustworthy </h1>
									</header>
<p>See that the John gospel isn't trustworthy by comparing John 2:19 and its context to the true record in Matthew 21:12-17. See how he never said that in Matthew? The lie in John 2:19 is the same false testimony given by two admitted liars to condemn Yashuah in Matthew 26:57-62!</p>

<p>The John gospel author also wrote Revelation which is proven to be untrustworthy too with Revelation 1:5. Many were raised from the dead before Yashuah, and evidence proving this is in the real gospel of Matthew 27:51-53, 1 Kings 17:17-24, 2 Kings 4:18-37, and 2 Kings 13:20-21.</p>

<p>The statement at the beginning of the "John" gospel is blasphemy: The creator of the heavens and earth is NOT a word! This is followed by the false statement that his son is him, a lie which has mislead countless people into ignoring Matthew 4:10 and breaking the 1st commandment!</p>

<p>Yashuah was speaking Aramaic when he said his words would never disappear in Matthew 24:35. Aramaic manuscripts don't contain the "Revelation" book, further proving that those aren't his words in it. The real words of Yashuah are recorded in the Aramaic gospel known as Matthew.</p>

<p>In Matthew 19:16-21, Yashuah said to keep the commands to obtain eternal life, but John 3:16 says you just need belief to not perish. Graveyards are full of those who believed in the fake John gospel who ignored Yashuah's real instructions in Matthew. Learn from their mistake!</p>
