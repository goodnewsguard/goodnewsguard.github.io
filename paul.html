										<h1>Paul: A Hidden Enemy</h1>
									</header>

									

<p>There is a hidden enemy who tried to hijack and corrupt the message of salvation in the New Testament, the same enemy the Matthew 24:23-26 warning is regarding. This article proves that Paul is this enemy, and that his false message of salvation empowers demons and fills graveyards.</p>

<p>Aramaic Matthew 1:18-21 shows that the real anointed one (משיח) is named Yahshuah (ישוע) which means "salvation". In Matthew 23:10, Yahshuah said not to call yourself leader (מדברנא) as there is ONLY ONE leader: The anointed one - Him! Paul is a false משיח and is NOT the leader!</p>

<p>Paul lied that Yahshuah ended the Old Testament commands in Ephesians 2:15. Paul lied that you're released from the law in Romans 7:6. In 2 Corinthians 3:7, he blasphemously lied that the 10 commandments lead to death, even though they were carved in stone by the source of life!</p>

<p>By Yahshuah's Matthew 5:17-19 standard, Paul is the LEAST in the heavens for his lies that Old Testament law has ended. Why obey the least in the heavens instead of Yahshuah the anointed one who was blessed with ALL power in the heavens and on earth? Follow Yahshuah to salvation.</p>

<p>Yahshuah's real leadership is in the gospel known as Matthew which shows that the Old Testament laws referenced in Matthew 5:17-19 haven't ended. Those laws are from our creator's mouth which we live by per Matthew 4:4, and we must obey them for eternal life per Matthew 19:16-19.</p>

<p>Paul's real name (mistranslated as "Saul") is spelled Shin-Aleph-Waw-Lamed in Aramaic Acts 9:1, the same spelling as the word for "underworld, grave, hell, pit" in Deuteronomy 32:22! This word is shared in both Aramaic and Hebrew. Hell is where Paul leads to if you follow him.</p>

<p>Paul's real name is the same as the 1st anointed king in 1 Sam 15:10-35, the tormented one who LOST the set-apart spirit and who tried to repeatedly murder the one who received it. Enemies overran him before he killed himself. He was beheaded after, nailed to a wall, then burned.</p>

<p>In Matthew 16:15-18, Yahshuah uses his apostle's name שמעון ("hearing" diminutive in Hebrew) as an analogy to explain that his church is built upon hearing his father. The Aramaic word Yahshuah used for "hell" that will not conquer his church sounds EXACTLY like Paul's real name!</p>

<p>The 3 aspects of Yahshuah's prophetic warning in Matthew 24:23-26 fit Paul's 3 false encounters with Yahshuah which Paul's false prophet Luke wrote in Acts:
<ol><li>Here or there = Acts 22:17-21</li>
<li>In the desert/wilderness = Acts 9:3</li>
<li>In the secret/inner chamber = Acts 23:10-11</li></ol></p>

<p>Paul deceives many because he was given cover by his prophet Luke. In Romans 13, Paul uses the cover Luke gave him in Acts to deceive many into obeying fake man-made laws over the true divine laws that Yahshuah said to obey. Paul said Mark would be useful to him in 2 Tim 4:11, making the gospels of both Mark and Luke suspicious.</p>

<p>Paul was a murdering Pharisee whose lies have created holocausts of Christians over time. Paul's prophet Luke let a revealing truth slip in Acts 19:13-16, that the salvation (ישוע) that Paul preaches empowers demons! The real ישוע warned NOT to believe Paul's message, so don't!</p>

<p>Paul distorts the real NT message like his Pharisees distort Torah with their corrupt traditions now filling the voluminous Pharisee Talmud, their yeast. It contains cruel traditions like NEVER using our creator's set-apart name! Obey Yahshuah over ALL man-made traditions & laws!</p>

<p>Jeremiah 31:31-33 shows that our creator's laws will be written in the mind (לב) in his NT, and this occurs when you're baptized as Yahshuah said in Matthew 28:19. Three specific set-apart names are required - Not 1 name as Paul used, and not a phrase with 3 titles like "son" and "father" as Christians use.</p>
